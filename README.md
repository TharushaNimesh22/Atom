## Robotics Design & Competition (EN2533) - Atom
Designed and developed an autonomous mobile robot capable of handling complex subtasks including line and dashed-line following, arrow following, grid navigation, box and ball picking, color recognition, barcode reading, ramp crossing, and wall navigation. The system was built around an Arduino Mega–based architecture using IR sensor arrays, distance sensors, color sensors, stepper motors, servo mechanisms, and a custom power management setup. A custom PCB was also designed to connect all the sensors, actuators, power modules and the arduino board together. I was primarily responsible for robot programming in C++ and code optimization to ensure reliability and accuracy under competition constraints.
